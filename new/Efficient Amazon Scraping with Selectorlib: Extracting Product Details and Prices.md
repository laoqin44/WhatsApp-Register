# Efficient Amazon Scraping with Selectorlib: Extracting Product Details and Prices

Amazon web scraping has become a valuable tool for extracting product details and prices for various use cases, such as market research and price monitoring. In this guide, we explore how to use Python Requests and Selectorlib to build a simple and efficient Amazon scraper.

## Introduction

Amazon's vast inventory provides an excellent resource for extracting structured data. Using Python and Selectorlib, you can set up an Amazon scraper to gather product details, including names, prices, descriptions, and reviews.

This project includes two simple scraping approaches that help you retrieve data from Amazon seamlessly:

1. **Scraping from a Terminal**: Execute the scraper directly from your terminal.
2. **Scraping the First Page**: Focus on collecting data from the first page of Amazon search results.
