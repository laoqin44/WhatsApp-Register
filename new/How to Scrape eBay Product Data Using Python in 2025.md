## Step 1: Prerequisites

### Get Your System Ready
Before you start, ensure the following:
1. **Python Installation**: Verify Python is installed on your system by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If itâ€™s not installed, download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Use pip to install the libraries needed for web scraping:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Navigate to your working directory and create a new Python file:
     ```bash
     mkdir ebay_scraper && cd ebay_scraper
     touch scraper.py
     ```

   - Open `scraper.py` in your preferred editor, and youâ€™re ready to start coding.

## Step 2: Scraping eBay Product Pages

### Target Example
For this tutorial, weâ€™ll scrape a real-world [eBay product page](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125575167955?_skw=mouse+wireless). The goal is to extract:
- Product Name
- Price
- Images
- Description
- Reviews

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### Extracting Product Name
To scrape the product name:
1. Inspect the product pageâ€™s HTML structure in your browser.
2. Identify the HTML element containing the name (e.g., `<h1>` tag).
3. Use BeautifulSoupâ€™s `find()` method to extract it.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Fetch the HTML
url = "https://www.ebay.com/itm/125575167955?_skw=mouse+wireless"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract the product name
product_name = soup.find("h1").text.strip()
print("Product Name:", product_name)
```

---

### Extracting Product Price
To locate the price:
1. Inspect the `<div>` containing the price, typically with a unique class like `x-price-primary`.
2. Use BeautifulSoup to extract its text.

```python
# Extract product price
price = soup.find("div", {"class": "x-price-primary"}).text.strip()
print("Price:", price)
```

---

### Extracting Product Images
Images on eBay are often stored in a carousel container. Hereâ€™s how to fetch all image URLs:

```python
# Extract image URLs
image_container = soup.find("div", {"class": "ux-image-grid"})
images = [img['src'] for img in image_container.find_all("img")]
print("Images:", images)
```

---

### Extracting Product Descriptions
Product descriptions are often within `<iframe>` tags. Hereâ€™s how to handle it:
1. Fetch the `<iframe>`'s `src` URL.
2. Parse the iframeâ€™s HTML for the description.

```python
# Extract iframe URL
iframe = soup.find("iframe", {"id": "desc_ifr"})['src']
iframe_response = requests.get(iframe)
iframe_soup = BeautifulSoup(iframe_response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract description from table or list
description = iframe_soup.find("div", {"id": "featurebullets_feature_div"}).text.strip()
print("Description:", description)
```

---

### Extracting Reviews
Reviews are typically listed as bullet points:
```python
# Extract reviews
reviews = [review.text.strip() for review in soup.find_all("li", {"class": "fdbk-container"})]
print("Reviews:", reviews)
```

---

## Step 3: Export Data to CSV

Once youâ€™ve scraped the data, organizing it in a CSV file ensures easy access and analysis. Use Pythonâ€™s `csv` module to export the data:

```python
import csv

# Organize scraped data
product_data = {
    "Name": product_name,
    "Price": price,
    "Images": images,
    "Description": description,
    "Reviews": reviews
}

# Write to CSV
with open("ebay_product_data.csv", mode="w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=product_data.keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow(product_data)
```

---

## Step 4: Scraping Multiple eBay Listings

To scale your scraping to multiple product pages:
1. Handle **pagination** by finding the "Next" button and iterating through the pages.
2. Extract product URLs from each page and repeat the scraping process.

```python
# Function to extract product links from search results
def extract_product_links(soup):
    return [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all("a", {"class": "s-item__link"})]

# Function to navigate pages
def get_next_page(soup):
    next_button = soup.find("a", {"type": "next"})
    return next_button['href'] if next_button else None

# Start scraping
current_url = "https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=mouse"
all_links = []

while current_url:
    response = requests.get(current_url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Collect product links
    all_links.extend(extract_product_links(soup))
    current_url = get_next_page(soup)

print("Collected Links:", all_links)
```

Export all collected links to a CSV:
```python
with open("product_links.csv", mode="w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Product Links"])
    writer.writerows([[link] for link in all_links])
```

## Step 5: Avoid Getting Blocked

eBay employs anti-bot measures, including rate-limiting and CAPTCHA challenges. To bypass these restrictions:
1. Use rotating proxies.
2. Add custom headers, such as `User-Agent`.
3. Introduce random delays between requests.

Or, use **ScraperAPI**, which automates these processes for you.
