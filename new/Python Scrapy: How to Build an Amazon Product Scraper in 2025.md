![Python Scrapy Amazon Product Scraper](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyaskan9k/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://assets-scrapeops.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Images/Playbooks/Scrapy-Playbook/scrapy-amazon-products.jpg)

In this guide, part of our **"How to Scrape X With Python Scrapy" series**, we'll explore how to build a Python Scrapy spider to crawl and scrape [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) for product information.

## Why Scrape Amazon?

Amazon is the go-to e-commerce site for web scraping due to its vast product catalog. Billions of product pages are scraped monthly for insights like prices, reviews, and rankings. This guide will focus on building a production-ready Scrapy spider for **Amazon search and product pages**.

## Architecting the Amazon Product Scraper

The design of your scraper will depend on several factors:

- **Use case:** Why are you scraping this data?
- **Data requirements:** What product data do you need (e.g., price, reviews, rankings)?
- **Frequency:** How often do you need to scrape the data?
- **Scale:** How much data will you collect?
- **Technical complexity:** Your level of expertise.

For this guide, we'll assume:

- **Objective:** Monitor product rankings for specific keywords and track products daily.
- **Data:** Collect rankings, prices, reviews, and other essential details.
- **Scale:** Small-scale scraping for a handful of keywords.
- **Storage:** Save data to a CSV file (with examples for MySQL and Postgres).

### Scraping Workflow

1. A **discovery crawler** collects product URLs from Amazon's search pages.
2. A **data scraper** extracts detailed product information from each product page.
3. Data is saved to a CSV file via [Scrapy Feed Exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html).

## Building an Amazon Product Crawler

### Step 1: Understand Amazon Search Pages

Amazon search pages display up to 20 products per page. For example, searching for "iPad" results in a URL like:

```
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ipad&page=1
```

Key parameters:

- `k`: The search keyword (e.g., `ipad`).
- `page`: The results page number.

Using these parameters, we can paginate through search results and extract product URLs.

![Amazon Search Page Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyaskan9k/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://assets-scrapeops.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Images/Playbooks/Web-Scraping-Playbook/how-to-scrape-amazon/how-to-scrape-amazon-search-page.png)

### Step 2: Build the Search Crawler

Create a Scrapy spider to crawl Amazon search pages and paginate through results for each keyword in your list.

### Step 3: Add a Product Scraper Callback

Update the crawler to extract product URLs and pass them to a **product scraper** via a callback. This scraper will extract product data like price, reviews, and features.

## Scraping Amazon Product Pages

### Step 1: Understand Product Pages

Amazon product pages are structured using ASIN codes (e.g., `B08J5F3G18`). These pages require custom parsers to extract data from HTML (unlike JSON-based APIs).

![Amazon Product Page Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyaskan9k/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://assets-scrapeops.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Images/Playbooks/Web-Scraping-Playbook/how-to-scrape-amazon/how-to-scrape-amazon-product-page.png)

### Step 2: Build the Product Scraper

The `parse_product_data()` method will parse responses from product pages, extracting details like:

```json
{
  "name": "Apple iPad 9.7-inch WiFi 32GB (Renewed)",
  "price": "$137.00",
  "stars": "4.6 out of 5 stars",
  "rating_count": "8,532 global ratings",
  "features": [
    "9.7-Inch Retina Display",
    "A9 third-generation chip",
    "1.2MP FaceTime HD Camera"
  ]
}
```

## Storing Scraped Data

Scrapy makes it simple to store data in:

- **CSV files:** Configure Scrapy's Feed Exports to dynamically create a file for each spider run.
- **AWS S3:** Save your files to an S3 bucket (guide [here](https://scrapeops.io/python-scrapy-playbook/scrapy-save-aws-s3/)).
- **Databases:** Export data to MySQL or Postgres for easier querying.

## Bypassing Amazon's Anti-Bot Protection

Amazon employs anti-bot measures like CAPTCHAs and IP bans. To scrape reliably, youâ€™ll need:

- **Rotating proxies**
- **User-agent rotation**
- **CAPTCHA solvers**

Alternatively, use a solution like **ScraperAPI** to handle these challenges for you. ScraperAPI provides:

- Proxy rotation
- CAPTCHA bypass
- Country-specific targeting
- JavaScript rendering

## Monitoring Your Scraper

For production scrapers, monitoring is essential. Use tools like **ScrapeOps Monitor** to:

- Track job performance.
- Schedule recurring scraping jobs.
- Set up alerts for failures.

## Deploying and Scheduling Your Scraper

To automate your scraper, deploy it to the cloud using ScrapeOps Job Scheduler. Connect it to servers like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Vultr to schedule daily or weekly scraping jobs.
