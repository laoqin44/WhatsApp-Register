## NewsCatcher

Another powerful tool from the same team, [NewsCatcher](https://github.com/kotartemiy/newscatcher), enables you to scrape news articles from almost any website. This library is ideal for gathering headlines or metadata from news websites.

Hereâ€™s an example JSON output from NewsCatcher:

```json
{
  "title": "Example Article",
