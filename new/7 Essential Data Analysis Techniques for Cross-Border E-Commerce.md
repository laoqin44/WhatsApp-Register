# 7 Essential Data Analysis Techniques for Cross-Border E-Commerce

When operating a cross-border e-commerce business, efficiently analyzing data is as critical as collecting and cleaning it. Data analysis is generally divided into two main types: **numerical analysis** and **visual analysis**. In this guide, we’ll walk you through key techniques in both areas to help you streamline your analysis process and boost operational efficiency.

## Numerical Analysis

### 1. Sales Aggregation: Classification Summation

#### Scenario:
You need to analyze total orders or sales figures across different countries, states, stores, time periods, or SKUs.

#### Method:
Use the classification summation feature of analytics tools like **ShuKuaiJing BI**, which works like Excel’s pivot table. Drag relevant fields, such as “country” or “ship-state,” into the classification section and your target field (e.g., “order ID”) into the summation section. Then, select your desired summation type (e.g., total orders or sales).

This value can then be used for further calculations.

### 2. Sales Aggregation by Custom Dimensions

#### Scenario:
If your sales data spans multiple regions, and you need to aggregate order numbers by continent-level dimensions.

#### Method:
With **ShuKuaiJing BI**, group countries into continents by using its classification feature. For instance, classify the United States, Mexico, and Canada under “North America” and Israel under “Asia.”

## Visual Analysis

### 1. Estimating FBA Stock Levels: Parameter Values

#### Scenario:
When calculating FBA stock replenishment, sellers often refer to historical data such as 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, or 60-day sales to estimate daily average sales and expected inventory levels.

#### Method:
Use **ShuKuaiJing BI’s Parameter Values** feature to bind frequently tested variables (e.g., weighting coefficients) to real-time parameters. This allows you to modify parameters directly within the report interface and instantly refresh the calculations.

Example: Assign weights of 50%, 25%, and 25% to 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day sales, respectively, for stable sales trends.

### 2. Highlighting Key Data: Conditional Formatting

#### Scenario:
You need to visually emphasize data trends in your final tables, such as identifying rising or declining average order values.

#### Method:
Apply **Conditional Formatting** in ShuKuaiJing BI. For example, use icons such as arrows to indicate changes in order value trends. You can also customize cell background colors, text colors, or graphic markers.

### 3. Monitoring Critical Data: Guidelines

#### Scenario:
You want to add alerts to your sales charts, such as identifying stores with sales below the average.

#### Method:
Use **Guidelines** in ShuKuaiJing BI to add visual indicators on graphs. Customize the name, value, and color of the guideline for clarity.

### 4. Automating Alerts: Automation

#### Scenario:
When conversion rates drop below 20%, you want an automatic notification sent to the responsible team for action.

#### Method:
Use **Automation** in ShuKuaiJing BI to set up data monitoring and alerts. Trigger notifications based on data updates or schedule them at specific times. Choose between SMS or in-system notifications.

### 5. Tracking Sales Performance: Drill-Down Analysis

#### Scenario:
Your monthly sales performance is underwhelming, and you need to pinpoint which store or product is underperforming.

#### Method:
Use the **Drill-Down** and **Data Linking** features in ShuKuaiJing BI to break down data by store or product level. Focus on the root cause and take corrective actions.
