## Skill 1: Collector Principles and Usage Examples

There are three main ways to collect Amazon data, depending on your goals:

### 1. Collecting Category Data
To collect data from a specific category, you need the **category link** or **node ID**. For example:

- A category link might look like this: `www.amazon.com/b?node=1044510`
- The general formula is: `www.amazon.com/b?node=NODE_ID`

Simply replace `NODE_ID` with the relevant ID for the desired category, and you can scrape all ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) in that category using tools like **Chuangxiang** or other scrapers.

### 2. Collecting Bestseller or Keyword Links
If you want to scrape bestseller items or keyword-related products:

- Input the relevant link or keyword into the scraper. For instance, entering the keyword `iPhone` will fetch data for products related to `iPhone`.

### 3. Collecting Keyword-Based Data
This method involves searching for products using specific keywords. For example:

- If you want to scrape data for the keyword `iPhone`, input the keyword into the scraper, and it will extract all related products.

#### Example Workflow for Scraping by Node ID
1. Navigate to the category you wish to scrape.
2. Copy the category node ID. For example: `www.amazon.com/b?node=1044510`.
3. Use a scraper like **Chuangxiang**, and input the node-based URL to begin scraping. This process will extract all ASINs within the category.

However, IP restrictions can limit the number of records you can scrape in one session. Tools like **Octoparse** or **LocoySpider** can also be used, but their learning curves and limitations vary.

## Skill 2: Collecting Amazon Search Keywords

Amazon's autocomplete search feature allows you to gather popular search keywords. Here's how you can use this to extract related search terms:

### Manual URL for Keyword Collection
For example, if you want to collect keywords related to `iPhone 7`, you can modify the search URL as follows:

```url
https://completion.amazon.com/search/complete?method=completion&q=iphone+7&search-alias=aps&client=amazon-search-ui-mobile&mkt=1
```

### Example Results
Using the above URL, the scraper returns a list of related terms, such as:

- iPhone 7 case
- iPhone 7 charger
- iPhone 7 wallet case
- iPhone 7 car mount

This method provides up to 10 related search terms for your keyword, which can be used for further analysis or data collection.

## Key Considerations

While these scraping tools and techniques are highly effective, it's essential to understand their limitations. For instance:

- **IP Bans:** Most tools rely on rotating proxies to avoid bans, but their effectiveness varies. This is where solutions like **ScraperAPI** shine, as they handle proxy management automatically.
- **Learning Curve:** Advanced tools like LocoySpider require significant time investment for learning but offer more flexibility.
